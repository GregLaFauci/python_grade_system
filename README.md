# python_grade_system

simple program to enter students names, add grades, and get report of average grade

***Main Menu***
1. Add Student
2. Remove Student
3. Add Grades for Student
4. Student Report Card
5. Student List
6. Exit Program

Currently learning python programming language and using this project as an opportunity to share learnings.

Program is driven by function to printMenu()
This creates a loop that only exits when user chooses #6

Would like to create a searchStudent function to re-use throughout the other functions that search for a student's name.
Also, need to address students with same first or last name.
